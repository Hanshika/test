What diff challenges have you faced white testing Mobile web app.?
Mobile application testing requires special test cases and techniques. The wide variety of mobile technologies, platforms, networks and devices presents a challenge when developing efficient strategies to test mobile software.
A mobile device is much more restricted compared to desktops – the underlying OS typically sandboxes each application and allows very limited inter process access, unless a phone is ‘rooted’. Controlling the UI navigation of a mobile device is harder – in addition to lack of control mentioned in the previous point, mobile UIX response times are harder to predict than desktop equivalents and hence makes screen grab based predictions of pass/fail harder. Mobile devices, by definition are not statically located entities – depending on where the device is, the network may introduce many challenges that completely break down a prior tested use-case The proliferation of different screen sizes and form factors make UI based testing more challenging as well
