leader elements

a leader element which is larger than all the elemnts in the array to its right


Start iterating rightmost elemnt keeping track of largest element 
if a larger elemnt is found then print it and set current leader  to current eleemnt
note that last eleemnt is leade since therre is no eleemnt to its right

last eleemnt is leader


current leader

Use two loops. The outer loop runs from 0 to size â€“ 1 and one by one picks all elements from left to right. 
The inner loop compares the picked element to all the elements to its right side. 
If the picked element is greater than all the elements to its right side, then the picked element is the leader.



perfect number
6! 1+2+3=6 when you add all the factors of number and  if you get same number then it will be perfect bumber
28!  1+2+4+7+14

sum -keep calulate values here
need to find factors
% moduloar- will checks num is divisble or not  give remainder or not
if remainder is 0 then only it will be pefect numbver
